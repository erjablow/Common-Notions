Common-Notions
==============

Life is to short to for programmers to write their own `Name` classes, `Address` classes, *etc*.  This repository is designed to contain classes for general use, that are in fact as obvious as Euclid's Common Notions:

1. Things which equal the same thing also equal one another.
1. If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal.
1. If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.
1. Things which coincide with one another equal one another.
1. The whole is greater than the part.
